# How does salt infulence microbial communities?

Questions:

1.  How is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	- Null: Microbial biodiversity (ex. richness) does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase as salt concentration lowers.
		- There is an inverse relationship between microbial richness and salinity.
2. How does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	- Null: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
